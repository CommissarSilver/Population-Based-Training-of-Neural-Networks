def stack_frames(stacked_frames, state, is_new_episode, stack_size=4):
    # Arguments:
    #   stacked_frames: A deque containing four frames
    #   state: Current frame
    #   is_new_episode: A boolean value which determines if we're stacking frames from a newly created episode or not
    #   stack_size: Determines the stack size. By default is 4.
    # Returns:
    #   stacked_state: a 84*84*4 deque containing the last 4 states(frames).
    # Implements:
    #   Calls the preprocess function on each new frame and then stacks #stack_size of frames together in a deque.
